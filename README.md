# Clima

A minimal Flutter app to fetch weather for current device location,
and optionally to enter another city and display its weather data
using openweathermap api.

## Requirements

- All build requirements on development machine for
either android, or ios, or both (Android SDK, XCode, 
essential build tools, et al.)
- flutter sdk
- dark sdk
- lots of disk space for all these storage-space-hogs

Once everything is installed and you can run flutter 
commands from terminal, you can build the project by:

- checking out this repo and cd into it on terminal,
- run `flutter build {ios | apk} # check docs for your platform`
- to install, run `flutter install` after the target device is connected (can be an emulator).
- for debug builds, only run `flutter run`; no need to install separately, it does it automatically on the connected device.
